## Vision
Our vision is to develop a dating app that creates meaningful connections between international students attending colleges abroad who may not have English as their first language. We aim to build an inclusive, secure, and user-friendly app that lets users meet like-minded individuals in a trusted environment. We also hope to learn and feel comfortable working with React Native over the course of the semester.

## Goals
1. Create a functional MVP (or minimal viable product): Basically, make a bare-bones app with core features like user registration, profile creation, swipe matching, messaging, and school email verification 
2. Open source contribution: Release the project as open-source to allow others to collaborate
3. Learn and feel comfortable working with React Native
